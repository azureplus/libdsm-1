# libdsm
  - This is a rewrote library based on the original libdsm library of Videolabs's organization.
  - The original libdsm you can visit here: https://github.com/videolabs/libdsm.
  - This library was developed to support iOS developers who want to handly implement this library to their projects instead of using static library that can not rewrite for personal purposes.
